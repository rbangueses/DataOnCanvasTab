# Data Presenter Plugin

This sample plugin presents task data within a new tab "External Data" on the task canvas.

It can be used to present data from a CRM or any other data source. This assumes you would perform a data-dip / CRM API call on Twilio Studio and add the information you want to the task attributes. This plugin then accesses the task attributes and presents them.

## Setup

If you want to add/remove/make changes to the information presented on the task canvas tab, edit the DataOnCanvasComponent.js.
